## Story
The wanderer was very tired and got lost, so he rested and fell asleep in a tree. Unfortunately, because the tree was near the red monster den, the wanderer was ambushed and taken to their village.

Funnily enough, the red monster wanted to release the traveler on one condition. That is, with a "blub-blub show" or "bubble show" to entertain them.
